# MCMan

Minecraft (server) Mananger.
Comes in 3 components:
- `mcman`, the Minecraft Server instance mananger. It takes full care of instances hosted by it, from downloading and setup, save files, to server lifecycle.
- `mcsetup`, just downloads Minecraft Server instances (and necessary libraries), and generates server lifecycle scripts
