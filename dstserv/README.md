# basic Don't Starve Together server scripts

- `dstserv_simple.sh` is a basic dedicated server runner that simply launches each shard and redirects its output to /dev/null. Supports IA, and has a crude backup system based on 7z. This one used to live [here](https://gist.github.com/rtk0c/2adfe8c000fabdb30b7f40d7ddaf5795)
- `dstserv_tmux.sh` is a modified version of the `_simple` version. It runs each shard in a tmux pane for easier admin. This one used to live [here](https://gist.github.com/rtk0c/f6ac0913e0b555da149e0ea5bbc5e409)
